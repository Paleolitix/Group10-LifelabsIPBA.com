<h3>
How long are viewers willing to spend watching one video?
</h3>

<ul>
<li>The average length of most videos on youtube is around 10 minutes.</li> <br>

<li>This is also the ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù for videos as it‚Äôs not too short, nor too long <br>for an entertaining
video. It also gives just the right amount of time to sneak in <br>one to two advertisements.</li> <br>

<li>TED-ED suggests that the ideal video length, to avoid losing viewers‚Äô attention, <br>

<img src="youtube.jpg" align="right"/ width="400" height="200" class="youtube">

 is 10 - 18 minutes.</li> <br>
 
<li>Based on a survey, the average time that people are willing to spend 
on a<br>single video is 11.7 minutes. However, for gaming-related content, <br>
that number increases to 24.7 minutes.</li> <br>

</ul>
