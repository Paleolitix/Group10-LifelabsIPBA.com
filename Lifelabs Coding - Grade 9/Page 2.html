<h3>Different Game Genres</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>First-Person Shooter</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
A first-person shooter (FPS) is a type of action video game in 
which the player controls <br>the protagonist or character. FPS games typically map 
the gamer's movements and<br> provide a view of what an actual person in the
game would see and do. The protagonist's <br>body is usually shown on the 
screen in the game. Typically, the player is given a large <br>arsenal of weapons 
(specific to the setting of the game)FPS is the genre for players <br>looking for a rush of adrenaline. 
</p>

<p>Examples of FPS are: Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Team Fortress 2, 
Valorant, <br> and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>RTS or Real-time Strategy</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Real-time strategy (RTS) pertains to a time-based video game in 
which resources <br>are used to construct units and beat an opponent. 
Real-time strategy games are<br> frequently compared to turn-based strategy 
games, in which each player has time <br>to carefully contemplate his next move 
without being concerned with his opponent's <br>moves. Real-time strategy games 
require players to attempt to develop resources,<br> defend bases, and launch 
assaults while also knowing that their opponent is doing<br> the same. Real-time 
strategy games are sometimes known as real-time <br>simulations or real-time war games.
</p>

<img src="RTS.jpg" align="right"/ width="400" height="200" class="RTS">

<p>Examples of RTS are: Company of Heroes 2:Ardennes Assault, 
Age of Empires, <br>Supreme Commander, Starcraft 2,and Empire of sin, 
Tropico sin</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Role-Playing Games</b></li>
</ul>

<p>RPG video games evolved from tabletop or pen-and-paper RPGs 
like Rolemaster <br>or Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) ‚Äì a form of game in 
which players actively describe <br>their characters' actions and ideas. 
The role of the "game master" (who serves as <br>both the storyteller and the referee) 
in video game RPGs is automated, and the<br> computer's artificial intelligence 
(AI) determines the behavior of the different <br>non-player characters (NPCs) and adversaries.
</p>

<img src="RPG.jpg" align="right"/ width="400" height="200" class="RPG">

<p>Examples of RPG: World of craft, Dark Souls, Fallout : 
New Vegas, <br>Planescape: Torment, and Chrono Trigger</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Multiplayer Online Battle Arena or MOBA</b></li>
</ul>

<p>This is also known for MOBA. The MOBA genre is 
rapidly evolving and updating.<br> While it is uncertain which features 
will ultimately be defining of the genre and <br>which will not, there are 
several developing parallels across the games. The goal <br>for the playing 
team is to keep the enemy team from destroying their home base. <br>Each base 
 or may not have tower defenses and may or may not generate allied NCP‚Äôs <br>
 (Non-player characters) that automatically assault the opponent‚Äôs defenses 
 along <br>predetermined pathways known as ‚Äú Lanes‚Äù in the games. The player's 
 characters<br> can freely roam the majority of the map, although they often 
 spend the majority <br>of their time battling with rival players in the lanes. 
 The team that destroys the <br>opponent‚Äôs base first wins.</p>

<img src="MOBA.jpg" align="right"/ width="400" height="200" class="MOBA">

<p>Examples of MOBA:  DOTA 2, Smite, League of Legends, Battlerite, 
Fault, <br>Esports Life Tycoon, Mobile Legends( IOS and android devices) </p>

<ul>
<li><b>Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games</b></li>
</ul>

<p>A massively multiplayer online role-playing game ( MMORPG) 
is a video game <br>that takes place in a persistent state world ( PSW) 
in which thousands, if not <br>millions of players build their characters in a 
role-playing environment. The <br>virtual environment in which the game is set is 
never still. Even while a player <br>logs out, events across the world are taking 
place that may have an influence <br>on the player when he or she logs back into the game. 
</p>

<img src="MMORPG.jpg" align="right"/ width="400" height="200" class="MMORPG">

<p>Examples of MMORPG:  A Tale in the Desert, A3; Still Alive, 
Ace Online, Achaea, <br>Adventure Land, Genshin Impact, and World of craft.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Sandbox Games</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Sandbox games or free-roaming and open world games
is one in which the player‚Äôs <br>character has few restrictions, 
allowing him or her to freely wander and modify a <br>virtual environment. 
A sandbox game, as opposed to a progression-style game,<br> emphasizes 
wandering and lets the player choose tasks. Instead of a divided region <br>
or numbered stages, a sandbox game generally takes place in a ‚Äúworld‚Äù in 
which <br>the player has complete control from beginning to end.
</p>
